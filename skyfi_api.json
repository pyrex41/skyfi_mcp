If the images were already delivered to the original destination, a new upload will be triggered redelivering the artefacts to the new bucket. Example:\n```json\nPOST https://app.skyfi.com/platform-api/orders/<ORDER_ID>/redelivery\nAccept: application/json\nContent-Type: application/json\nX-Skyfi-Api-Key: <API_KEY>\n\n{\n  \"deliveryDriver\": \"GS|S3|AZURE|...\", // new delivery driver\n  \"deliveryParams\": {\n    ... // new delivery parameters\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Folder structure\nThe artefacts associated with an order will be uploaded to a folder named after the `order_id`. If you need to add a prefix to the folder structure, you can utilise the optional parameter `subfolder` in the `deliveryParams` object.\n\n## Area of interest specifics\n### Format\nAll **AOI** fields are expected to be a simple convex **POLYGON** in the [WKT format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry), e.g.\n```\nPOLYGON ((-97.672442134274 30.289674402322873, -97.67245401025714 30.244570392925723, -97.72440367372722 30.244570392925723, -97.72441554971037 30.289674402322873, -97.672442134274 30.289674402322873))\n```\n#### AOI limits:\n- orders should not have more than 500 vertices\n- archive searhes should not have more than 500 vertices & area more than 500,000 sqkm\n- notifications should not have more than 500 vertices & area more than 500,000 sqkm\n\n### Calculate the size of the AOI in sqkm\nThe link below is a Notebook to help you calculate the size of your Area of Interest (AOI) in sqkm. This calculation is essential for determining the order cost and ensuring compliance with our AOI constraints, such as minimum and maximum area requirements. Please note that the notebook will only generate size and not cost, but cost can be generated using our pricing guidelines [here](https://skyfi.com/files/SkyFi_Pricing_2025.pdf).\n\nTo access the Notebook and learn how the AOI area is calculated, please use the following link:\n\n[Click here to access the Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yM2dfCFupCe1exrbhkinHDsenJ8HSp-b)\n\nHere's a brief overview of the steps involved:\n\n1. Open the provided notebook using the provided link.\n2. Create a copy of the notebook in your personal Google Drive or preferred environment.\n3. Update the polygon with your specific AOI.\n4. Follow the provided code and instructions to input the AOI square polygon coordinates, either manually or from previous steps of generating the AOI.\n5. Run the cell associated with the AOI area calculation. The notebook will provide the area of the AOI in square kilometers.\n\nBy utilizing the provided Notebook, you will be able to calculate the area of your AOI accurately. This is helpful for determining the order cost and verifying compliance with our AOI constraints, such as minimum and maximum area limitations.\n\nPlease note that the provided notebook assumes a basic understanding of Python programming. In case you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to reach out at [api@skyfi.com](mailto:api@skyfi.com) for assistance.\n\n\n### Generate an AOI with a center point\nTo identify a polygonal Area of Interest in sq. km. given a center point, you can use the provided Python notebook.\n\n[Click here to access the Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15Bf81qL5m5x3g_-1vGe5yxZu7pGVjFy2)\n\nHere's a brief overview of the steps involved:\n\n1. Open the provided notebook by clicking on the link above.\n2. Make a copy of the notebook to your personal Google Drive or preferred environment.\n3. Change the values of the center point and the desired area in sqkm\n4. Execute the notebook cells in order, ensuring that any required dependencies are installed.\n5. Retrieve the generated AOI square polygon from the output. These coordinates can be used in your API requests to obtain satellite imagery for your specific area.\n\nBy following these instructions, you will be able to define a customized AOI square polygon based on a center point and a desired area size. This polygon can then be used in this API to order satellite imagery for your specific area of interest.\n\nPlease note that the provided notebook assumes a basic understanding of Python programming. In case you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to reach out at [api@skyfi.com](mailto:api@skyfi.com) for assistance.\n\n\n## Opendata\nSentinel2 images can be ordered through this API using the `DAY` or `MULTISPECTRAL` products on the `LOW` resolution. We support other opendata products which will have the `price_for_one_square_km` set to 0. Ordering these images will be free of charge. Finding all of our opendata options can be done on our website https://app.skyfi.com/explore/open or through the `/archives` endpoint specifying the `openData: true` request option.\n\n\n## Pass Prediction and Selection\n\n### Overview\nWhen creating tasking orders, you can use pass prediction (feasibility) results to select specific satellite passes. This ensures your order uses the exact satellite pass you evaluated during feasibility checks.\n\n### Planet Pass Selection\nFor Planet tasking orders, you can specify a `provider_window_id` from the feasibility response:\n\n1. **Get feasibility results** with available passes from the `/feasibility` endpoint\n2. **Select a specific pass** from the opportunities list, which includes a `provider_window_id`\n3. **Include the provider_window_id** in your tasking order request:\n\n```json\nPOST https://app.skyfi.com/platform-api/order-tasking\n{\n  \"aoi\": \"POLYGON(...)\",\n  \"window_start\": \"2025-01-20T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"window_end\": \"2025-01-25T23:59:59Z\",\n  \"product_type\": \"DAY\",\n  \"resolution\": \"VERY_HIGH\",\n  \"provider_window_id\": \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\",  // From feasibility response\n  \"required_provider\": \"PLANET\",\n  // ... other parameters\n}\n```\n\nWhen `provider_window_id` is provided for Planet orders, the system will task that specific satellite pass, ensuring you get exactly what you evaluated during feasibility.\n\n### Umbra SAR Pass Selection\nFor Umbra SAR tasking orders, pass selection works differently - it's based on the **AOI combined with date and time window** rather than a window ID:\n\n1. **Get feasibility results** with available passes from the `/feasibility` endpoint\n2. **Note the specific pass timing** you want (each pass has precise start/end times)\n3. **Create your tasking order** with a time window that matches the desired pass:\n\n```json\nPOST https://app.skyfi.com/platform-api/order-tasking\n{\n  \"aoi\": \"POLYGON(...)\",  // Must match the AOI used in pass-prediction\n  \"window_start\": \"2025-01-20T14:30:00Z\",  // Align with specific pass start time\n  \"window_end\": \"2025-01-20T14:45:00Z\",    // Align with specific pass end time\n  \"product_type\": \"SAR\",\n  \"resolution\": \"VERY_HIGH\",\n  \"required_provider\": \"UMBRA\",\n  \"sar_product_types\": [\"SICD\", \"GEC\"],\n  // ... other SAR parameters\n}\n```\n\n**Important for Umbra**: The combination of AOI + time window determines which pass is selected. To ensure you get a specific pass:\n- Use the exact same AOI from pass-prediction\n- Set your window_start and window_end to tightly match the desired pass timing\n- The Umbra system will select the matching pass\n\n## Webhook Events\n\n### Order Event Webhook\nWhen you create an order with a `webhook_url` parameter, we'll send HTTP POST requests to your endpoint whenever the order status changes. Our webhook client has a timeout of 2 seconds and will retry up to 3 times until receiving a 200 response.\n\n#### Webhook Payload Structure\n```json\n{\n  \"order_info\": {\n    // Full order information (TaskingOrderResponse or ArchiveOrderResponse)\n    \"id\": \"uuid\",\n    \"order_type\": \"TASKING|ARCHIVE\",\n    \"status\": \"current_status\",\n    // ... other order fields\n  },\n  \"event\": {\n    \"status\": \"triggering_status\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n    \"message\": \"optional message\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Possible Webhook Event Statuses\nYour webhook will be called when the order transitions to any of these statuses:\n\n- **CREATED** - Order has been created\n- **STARTED** - Order processing has started\n- **PAYMENT_FAILED** - Payment processing failed\n- **PLATFORM_FAILED** - Internal platform error occurred\n- **PROVIDER_PENDING** - Order sent to satellite provider\n- **PROVIDER_COMPLETE** - Provider has captured/retrieved the imagery\n- **PROVIDER_FAILED** - Provider was unable to fulfill the order\n- **PROCESSING_PENDING** - Internal processing of imagery has started\n- **PROCESSING_COMPLETE** - Processing is complete\n- **PROCESSING_FAILED** - Processing failed\n- **DELIVERY_PENDING** - Delivery to your storage bucket has started\n- **DELIVERY_COMPLETED** - Imagery successfully delivered to your storage\n- **DELIVERY_FAILED** - Delivery to storage failed\n- **INTERNAL_IMAGE_PROCESSING_PENDING** - Additional image processing in progress\n\n## Pricing\nTo obtain information about the pricing details for our satellite imagery API, you can refer to our general pricing document. It provides a comprehensive overview of the pricing structure and associated costs.\n\nYou can access the pricing document by clicking [here](https://skyfi.com/files/SkyFi_Pricing_2025.pdf).\n\nPlease note that the pricing document outlines the general pricing information, but for specific details and a tailored offer, we recommend contacting us directly at [api@skyfi.com](mailto:api@skyfi.com).
