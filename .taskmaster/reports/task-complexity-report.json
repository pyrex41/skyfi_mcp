			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Phoenix Project and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This task involves basic project initialization and dependency addition, which is straightforward with Phoenix CLI and mix.exs edits. Low technical challenges, minimal dependencies, and simple testing make it low complexity."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Phoenix Web Layer",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Configuring multiple config files, router, endpoint, and telemetry requires understanding Phoenix architecture and environment setups. Moderate effort due to multiple components and integration into supervision tree, with dependencies on task 1."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement MCP Channel Join and Hello",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Implementing Phoenix Channel with join and message handling involves pattern matching and integration with McpProtocol. Moderate complexity due to real-time aspects and testing with ChannelTest, dependent on web layer setup."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Tool Request Handling in Channel",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Adding async handling with Task.async for tool requests and response pushing introduces concurrency challenges. Higher complexity for error handling and streaming, with dependencies on channel implementation and protocol dispatch."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create MCP Protocol Module",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Defining tool schemas and dispatch logic is straightforward pattern matching. Moderate effort for ensuring correct JSON schemas and unit testing, dependent on channel handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement SkyfiClient Module",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Building a Tesla-based HTTP client wrapper involves configuration and authentication handling. Moderate complexity for API integration and mocking in tests, dependent on project setup."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Auth Module",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Simple API key passthrough with basic validation is low-effort. Minimal technical challenges, straightforward testing, dependent on SkyfiClient."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Search Imagery Tool",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Tool implementation with AOI normalization and API call formatting. Moderate for parameter handling and error cases, with dependencies on protocol, client, and auth modules."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Remaining Tools",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into four separate subtasks, one for each tool: check_feasibility, get_price_estimate, place_order, and list_previous_orders. Each subtask should focus on implementing the call/2 function, API dispatching, and unit testing.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing four similar tools requires repetitive but careful work for each API endpoint. Higher complexity due to multiple units, potential for shared code, and comprehensive testing; recommend subtasks for parallel development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Integration Testing and Deployment Preparation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "End-to-end testing with Claude Desktop and deployment prep involve manual testing, documentation, and platform-specific configs. Moderate effort with integration challenges and dependencies on all core implementations."
